# directRNAseqAnalysis

These two custom scripts are designed for the analysis of data generated through ONT direct RNA sequencing.

## Script 1: Data Processing and Transcript Identification
The first script, script1.sh, processes reads stored in FASTQ files using a provided reference transcript file. The script must be executed in a directory containing only the relevant input files. The run command is as follows:

./script1.sh transcript_file.fasta

### Dependencies
This script requires the following tools:

NanoPlot for quality control (https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot)
minimap2 for read alignment (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
samtools for SAM/BAM file processing (https://github.com/samtools/samtools)
NanoCount for transcript quantification (https://github.com/a-slide/NanoCount)

### Workflow
Read Alignment: Reads are aligned to the reference transcripts using minimap2.
File Conversion: The resulting SAM file is converted into a sorted and indexed BAM file using samtools.
Transcript Quantification: The alignment is analyzed with NanoCount, which counts transcripts and identifies genes through a series of bash commands.
Quality Control: NanoPlot automatically assesses the quality of each read file; however, no quality threshold is applied, and all reads are included in the analysis.

### Output
The script produces a results table named Results.csv with the following columns:

Column 1: Name of the read file
Column 2: Number of identified transcripts
Column 3: Number of identified genes

## Script 2: Group Comparisons
The second script, script2.sh, compares transcript data between two user-provided files generated by script1.sh with the .gene.txt extension. The run command is as follows:

./script2.sh groupA.gene.txt groupB.gene.txt

### Output
This script generates three output files:

Transcripts unique to the first group (groupA).
Transcripts unique to the second group (groupB).
Transcripts common to both groups.

## Limitations
Currently, both scripts are designed to work exclusively with reference transcript files downloaded from FlyBase.
